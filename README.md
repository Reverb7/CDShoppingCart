Running this GitHub repository

Before starting, make sure you have Git, the latest Java Development Kit (JDK), Eclipse IDE, and JUnit libraries installed on your system. If you need to install any of these tools, you can download them from the official websites provided in the text.

Once you have all the prerequisites installed, you can start setting up the project. First, clone the GitHub repository to your desired workspace directory using the git clone command. You will need to replace the <username> and <repository_name> placeholders with the actual details.

Next, import the project into Eclipse by going to File > Import, then expand Git and select Projects from Git. Choose URI as the import source and paste the cloned repository URL into the URI field. Select Import existing projects and choose the directory where you cloned the repository. Click Finish to import the project.

To run the project, you need to configure the build path by right-clicking on the project in the Package Explorer and selecting Properties. Navigate to Java Build Path and go to the Libraries tab. Click Add External JARs and browse to the location of the downloaded JUnit libraries (e.g., junit-*.jar files). Click apply and close.

Finally, to use JUnit for testing, you need to identify the test classes by looking for classes ending with Test or containing test methods annotated with @Test. To run JUnit tests, right-click on the test class or package containing tests. Select Run As and choose JUnit Test. Alternatively, you can use the JUnit view in Eclipse (Run > Run Configurations > JUnit).
